A character creation application for the fifth edition of the tabletop role-playing game, Dungeons and Dragons. 
The application is used as a base for users to create their own D&D character, or multiple characters. 
The character creation application includes e.g. choosing a race and class, ability point scoring, adding a picture of the 
character and some features, traits and background story. Users can also save their character’s info in a file form, and open 
the old ones for viewing and editing.
